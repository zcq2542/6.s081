   * > or for all file descriptors referring to the write end to be closed;
   * > in the latter case, read will return 0, just as if the end of a data file had been reached.
   * > The fact that read blocks until it is impossible for new data to arrive is one reason
   * > that it’s important for the child to close the write end of the pipe before executing wc above:
   * > if one of wc ’s file descriptors referred to the write end of the pipe, wc would never see end-of-file.
